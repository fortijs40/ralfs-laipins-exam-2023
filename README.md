# exam-2023
 
I had to change main.css because #id's were different in songs.vue view than it was in template. 
For example in main css - there were values #index, #title, but in our given songs.vue template the id's were #td-index and #td-title.
I gave reasoning in the css file.

Also There were 2 songs with the same ID, I just gave one of them random letter so they aren't the same
